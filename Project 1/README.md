# Project 1 – Image Processing Fundamentals
## Problem Statement

This project discusses the way computers analyze and process digital images. The objective is to learn the fundamental principles of image processing like color representation, geometric transformation and elementary matrix operation, which are the backbones of the modern AI systems.

## Approach

The lab walked through several fundamental image-processing techniques, including:

- Loading and displaying images in Python
- Understanding how pixel values are stored numerically
- Separating RGB channels
- Converting between color spaces
- Performing geometric transformations
- Applying simple operations to inspect and modify image structure

These exercises illustrate how computers process visual data step-by-step, preparing the groundwork for more advanced machine learning models.

## Results

This experiment was more based on conceptual learning and visualization, and not on quantitative model behavior. The products were the transformed images, separated color channels and the examples of the image matrices changing with different operations.

## Key Findings

- It was most interesting to notice that computers see images solely as a matrix of numbers, in contrast to the human eye which sees images as a whole.
- The RGB separation, resizing, and geometric transformations are some of the techniques that offer a conceptual framework of the generative AI systems, which manipulate the image matrices to generate new outputs.
- Most of the fundamental skills used in this lab are the basics which the initial research of generative AI work based itself on.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- OpenCV / PIL (depending on the notebook)
- Matplotlib

## How to Run This Project

- Open the notebook:
    - L02_and_J02_Okyere_Jeremy_ITAI1378.ipynb
- Run in Google Colab or any local environment with Python 3.8+
- Install required libraries if running locally:
```bash
    - pip install numpy matplotlib opencv-python pillow
```
- Execute the cells in order to reproduce the visualizations and transformations.
