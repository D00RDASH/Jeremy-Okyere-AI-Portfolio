# Jeremy-Okyere-AI-Portfolio

I am in the process of learning the principles of machine learning and focusing on the practical development of models, understanding of data, and the concepts of neural networks. I intend to establish a solid background in AI and expand to more sophisticated applications with the help of formal education and practical experimentation.

## About Me

I am committed to learning how smart systems operate and how they can be implemented to address real-life challenges. The aspects of my learning process include creating practicable skills, enhancing my problem-solving skills, and developing my intuition of machine learning workflows.
