# Jeremy-Okyere-AI-Portfolio

I am in the process of learning the principles of machine learning and focusing on the practical development of models, understanding of data, and the concepts of neural networks. I intend to establish a solid background in AI and expand to more sophisticated applications with the help of formal education and practical experimentation.

## About Me

I am committed to learning how smart systems operate and how they can be implemented to address real-life challenges. The aspects of my learning process include creating practicable skills, enhancing my problem-solving skills, and developing my intuition of machine learning workflows.

## Skills
* Basic Python Knowledge
* Patience
* Perseverance
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Data Preprocessing
* Neural Network Fundamentals
* Model Training & Evaluation Basics
* Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Google Colab

## ComputerVision-ITAI2376

This course introduces core computer vision concepts and practical techniques for analyzing and understanding visual data, including:

- Working with images and video data
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Feature extraction and classical vision methods
- Building and training deep learning models for vision tasks
- Tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation
- Evaluating and improving vision models
- Running experiments in Python/Colab using libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, and PyTorch/TensorFlow

Project folders from this course are included in this repository with dedicated documentation.
